## Overview of the project

## Project : Image Classification
Train a CNN on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits using TensorFlow.

### Objective

Train a CNN model using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits (0 to 9) from the MNIST dataset with high accuracy.

### Key Activities

✔️ Load and preprocess MNIST data (normalize & reshape).

✔️ Build a CNN model with Conv2D, Pooling, Flatten, Dense layers.

✔️ Train and validate the model.

✔️ Evaluate accuracy on test data.

✔️ Visualize predictions and errors.

### Technologies Used

* Python

* TensorFlow / Keras

* MNIST Dataset

* NumPy, Matplotlib (for data & plots)

### Key Insights
* CNNs work well for image classification.

* Normalization speeds up training.

* Dropout helps reduce overfitting.

* Simple models can achieve >98% accuracy on MNIST.

* Errors often come from confusing digits.
